        <h2>A longer bio</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a first year Computer Science student who is currently working at a local ISP. It's exhausting, but I've been managing
            to do both so far. My job involves, among other things, provisioning and configuring new customer equipment placed by the ISP's
            technicians, who also call me and my team to solve trickier situations, so things can get quite technical at times.
        </p>
        <p>
            This ISP job is my first job. Before entering University, I finished a high school that also
            provided me a technical electronics course.

            My interests involve both retro and current tech, electronics, programming, networking and

            the navbar on top of every page.
